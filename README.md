### About me :wave:
Hi, my name is Denti. My journey in the field of Quality Assurance began in 2019, when I first became involved in software testing and ensuring product quality before release. That early experience opened my eyes to the importance of the QA role in creating digital products that are reliable, functional, and user-friendly.

As my interest in system analysis grew, I also studied the role of a System Analyst to understand how business requirements are translated into clear and structured system designs. Along the way, I took on several side projects as a System Analyst, where I was involved in requirements gathering, documentation creation, and developing UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams to illustrate process flows, system structures, and component relationships.

Combining my experiences in both QA and System Analysis has given me a more comprehensive perspective on the software development lifecycle. I can evaluate quality not only from the final result but also from how a system is designed and planned from the very beginning.

In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase the practical skills I have gained through self-study and professional experience. I am committed to continuing my growth in this field. I have also started learning test automation, so my current focus is on deepening my knowledge (and hands-on practice!) in this area. I believe that QA is not just about finding bugs, but about ensuring that every process, requirement, and system design aligns to create a better product.

### My experience :office:
My first professional experience in the QA field began when I worked as a Junior QA Engineer at PT. Sinarmas Multiartha, Tbk. In this role, I experienced significant growth, both in technical skills and soft skills. I learned to work with various tools for creating bug reports, writing test scripts, and understanding the fundamentals of test automation. This position also helped me develop stronger analytical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills in a real project environment.

My introduction to the world of Quality Assurance actually began during my university studies, particularly while working on my thesis, where I was required to conduct software testing as part of the research process. That early exposure sparked my interest in QA and eventually motivated me to pursue it as a professional career.

Working in QA has strengthened my understanding of software development, test processes, and product quality. It has also motivated me to continue learning and expanding my skill set in both manual and automation testing.
